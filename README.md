# os-firewall
the script written above will help you to maintain your own customized firwall where you can add some url 
and banne these urls from browsing such that when some onr type these urls in the browser then they will get 
connection error for those urls.

You will get the option to add the new url to be blocked, to show the list of the urls you have blocked and 
to delete the particular url from being blocked from your browser.

Thank you.
